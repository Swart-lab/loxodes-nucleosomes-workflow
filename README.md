Nucleosome sequencing analysis for Loxodes magnus
=================================================

Loxodes magnus MIC and MAC nuclei were sorted with FACS. Nucleosomal DNA was
prepared with Atlantis dsDNAse digest.

Data have been deposited in ENA https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB55146

## Workflow outline

 * Map nucleosomal DNA library to Loxodes magnus MAC reference assembly (Falcon assembler)
 * Also filter assembly to exclude low-complexity repeat regions previously annotated with TRF (min 1 kbp region)
 * Evaluate coverage and nucleosomal DNA fragment length distribution
 * Global phaseogram of nucleosome positioning relative to each other
 * Phaseogram of nucleosome positioning relative to starts of gene features (TSS data not available)
